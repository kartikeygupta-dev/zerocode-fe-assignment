Frontend chatbot project using HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP and JAVASCRIPT
# 💬 Chatbot Web Application

This is a front-end chatbot web application built using **HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)**, and **JavaScript**.  
It includes user authentication, chatbot interaction, voice input, and responsive design.

> ❗ Note: The original task recommended using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I completed the project using core web technologies instead, based on my current skills and to focus on functionality.

## 🎯 Why I Used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript

The original assignment suggested using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.  
However, I chose to build this project using **HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript** because:

- 🧱 I currently have strong foundational skills in these core web technologies.
- 🚀 I wanted to focus on implementing real functionality — like login, chatbot UI, voice input, and dark mode — rather than learning a new framework in a short time.
- 🧠 This approach allowed me to complete all core features independently and demonstrate my front-end development ability clearly.
- 📚 I’m actively learning modern frameworks (React/Tailwind) and will soon apply them in future projects.
